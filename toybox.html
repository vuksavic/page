    <p>this is a toybox, with all the little things i made in the past, present and future.</p>
    <p>everything is supposed to go into iframes, so they're all immediately accessible.</p>
    <div id="toys">
        <iframe src="/toybox/basketball-score/index.html" width="300px" height="200px" style="border: none;"></iframe>
        <iframe src="/toybox/blackjack/index.html" width="300px" height="350px" style="border: none;"></iframe>
        <iframe src="/toybox/airhockey/index.html" width="400px" height="400px" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>yes, iframes are a bad idea. i know. but they're fun to make, and they work for now.</p>
    <p>i'll be slowly releasing more toys here over time, so keep this page bookmarked somewhere.</p>
