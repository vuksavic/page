## my public webpage
a website i built for myself maybe around 8-9 years ago that should use some serious ~~rewriting~~/redesigning

currently hosted on [rw.rs](https://rw.rs/)
- [ ] finish odinproject
- [x] redesign the page, keep it simple
- [ ] system that checks for changes in [curicullum-vitae](https://github.com/vuksavic/curicullum-vitae) and keeps an always updated pdf(or any other file format) available on the page(ci/cd pipeline)
- [ ] maybe implement some css framework?
